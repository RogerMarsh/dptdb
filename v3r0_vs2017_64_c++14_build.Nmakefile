# Build V3R0 in Microsoft VS 2017 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt at c++14.

# The makefile naming convention arose from using Developer Command Prompt
# to do the initial work getting 32 bit DPT running again.

# A consequence is the naming convention for these makefiles appends '_32'
# to the Python element of the name for x86 (32 bit) builds, but '_64' to
# the Visual Studio element of the name for x64 (64 bit) builds.

# Build directory suffix.
# Usually indicates the c++ standard. eg: 'c++14'.
# Must be same as given in the 'copy' makefile which created the build
# directory.
