# Build V3R0 in Microsoft VS 2022 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt at c++20.

# The makefile naming convention arose from using Developer Command Prompt
# to do the initial work getting 32 bit DPT running again.

# A consequence is appending '_32' to the Python element of the name, if
# there is one, for x86 (32 bit) builds; but '_64' to the Visual Studio
# element of the name for x64 (64 bit) builds.

# Build directory suffix.
# Usually indicates the c++ standard. eg: 'c++14'.
# Must be same as given in the 'copy' makefile which created the build
# directory.
