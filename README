dptdb contains Python wrappers for the DPT database API.

You will need the DPT documentation from www.dptoolkit.com to use this package.  There is no separate documentation for Python.


To install the dptdb package from source type

<path to>/python setup.py install

at the command prompt of an MSYS shell with setup.py in the current directory.


This is dptdb.dpt3.0-0.5 which means version 0.5 of dptdb including version 3.0 of the DPT API.

A Binary distribution from this source will be named like dptdb.py3.3.dpt3.0-0.5 to indicate the major version of Python (3.3 here) on which it was built.


Build Dependencies:

Python 2.6 or later.
SWIG 2.0.8 or later.
Minimal SYStem 1.0.10  (MSYS)
MSYS Developer Tool Kit 1.0.1
MINGW 3.4.5
	binutils-2.17.50-20060824-1.tar.gz
	gcc-core-3.4.5-20060117-3.tar.gz
	gcc-g++-3.4.5-20060117-3.tar.gz
	mingw-runtime-3.14.tar.gz
	mingw-utils-0.3.tar.gz
	w32api-3.11.tar.gz


Runtime Dependencies:

Python 2.6 or later provided the major version (2.6 for example) is the same as the Python used to build dptdb.


Notes:

This package is built from a DPT API source code distribution, DPT_V3R0_DBMS.ZIP by default.

The dptapi.py and _dptapi.pyd modules are built using SWIG and MinGW for a particular major version of Python.  In particular a _dptapi.pyd built for Python2.6 will work only on Python2.6 and so on. 

The DPT API distribution contains independent scripts and instructions to build the contents of this package mentioning earlier versions of the build dependencies.  So dptdb will run on Python 2.4 or later but this setup is constrained by using features introduced at Python 2.6.

It is possible to install this package in a Python installed on any platform but it will work only on a Python built for the Microsoft Windows platform.
