"""Add records to databases.

The commit, backout, txn_per_record and deferred arguments control the
environment of the add records run.

deferred: True - index updates are deferred and transactions are disabled.
                commit, backout, and txn_per_record are ignored.
txn_per_record: True - each record is added in a separate transaction.
commit: True - transactions are explicitly committed.
                If commit is False a record is not added in a separate
                transaction.
backout: True - transactions are explicitly backed out.
                Default is False.
                If backout is False a record is not added, and then backed
                out, in a separate transaction.

If commit and backout are both False the default action, by default commit,
occurs when the database is closed.
