# Notes written in August 2023.
# The development environment has setuptools.
# The intended consequence of the two 'include' statements is:
#   _dptapi.pyd gets into sdist and wheel archives produced by build.
#   pydpt-test.py gets into sdist archives produced by build.
# 'python -m build ...' is done in two contexts:
#   Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt <year> where both sdist and
#   wheel archives are produced and published.
#   Msys2 mingw32 where just the wheel archive is produced and used
#   to install on the box which produced the wheel, but not published.
# The makefile project which produces the Visual Studio and Msys2
# archives is published.
